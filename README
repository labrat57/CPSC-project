efficient Point Mapping system

The goal of this project is to be able to calculate the most effecient path between up to 5 points while keeping the combined paths under a lenth restriction. 
A project like this could be used to design a more efficient transit system for a city or walking paths in a community.

To use our algorithm, begin by inptuting the 8 X coordinates followed by the 8 Y coordinates into the program. 
The program will then prompt you for your maximum path length.

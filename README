Efficient Point Mapping System

The goal of this project is to be able to calculate the most efficient path between up to 5 points while keeping the combined paths under a length restriction. 
A project like this could be used to design a more efficient transit system for a city or walking paths in a community.

To use our algorithm, begin by inputting the 4 X coordinates followed by the 4 Y coordinates into the program. 
The program will then prompt you for your maximum path length.

The program then calculates the distances between all the input values. These are then turned into vectors.  And are returned to us as vector lengths for the 6 possible vectors.

The user must then go run the roughDraft.java file. This file will find every possible combination of vectors. It will also eliminate the options that are less than 3 vectors as they arenâ€™t valid for our use.

The user can then match the vector lengths given in the Main.java file to their appropriate given in the output. If the addition of the lengths in the order of the vectors exceed the maximum length the user specified at the start of the program, they can disregard that vector combination. 
Once the user is satisfied with their vector combinations they can run them into the Test efficieny file to find the most efficient path

efficient Point Mapping system

The goal of this project is to be able to calculate the most effecient path between up to 5 points while keeping the combined paths under a lenth restriction. 
A project like this could be used to design a more efficient transit system for a city or walking paths in a community.

To use our algorithm, begin by inptuting the 8 X coordinates followed by the 8 Y coordinates into the program. 
The program will then prompt you for your maximum path length.

the program then goes calculates the distances between all the input values. These are then turned into vectors. 
once we have obtained the vectors the program calculates all possible combinations of more than 3 vecotrs. these points are then sorted to make sure they are under the maximum lentgh.
Once the combinations are sorted they are then put through a final algorithm that finds the most efficient combination of vectors.
